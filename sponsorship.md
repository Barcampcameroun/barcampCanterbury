Sponsorship
===========

BarCamp Canterbury is a 'free to attend' un-conference where the attendees create the content and give the talks. The event is loosely based around the topic of technology. Over the years, this has been a highly successful event where the impassioned members of local community and beyond share their experiences.

BarCamp's are memorable events that are heavily reported and shared by the attendee's via social media. Previous events can be seen on Twitter [#bccant](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bccant). Read more about BarCamp Canterbury at [barcampcanterbury.com](https://barcampcanterbury.com/).
