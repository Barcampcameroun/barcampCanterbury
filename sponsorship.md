Sponsorship
===========

BarCamp Canterbury is a free-to-attend un-conference where the attendees create the content and give the talks. The event is loosely based around the topic of technology. Over the years, this has been a highly successful event where impassioned members of the local community and beyond share their experiences.

BarCamps are memorable events that are heavily reported and shared by the attendees via social media. Previous events can be seen on Twitter [@barcampcant](https://twitter.com/barcampcant) [#bccant](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bccant). Read more about BarCamp Canterbury at [barcampcanterbury.com](https://barcampcanterbury.com/). The event hosts about 100 attendees.

Even if you are unable to contribute financially, providing freebies or prizes would always be appreciated by attendees.

Talking at our event about interesting topics that may relate to your business/area are always valued.
